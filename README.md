This is [Martin Newell's teapot](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Utah_teapot) which is defined as a set of 32
cubic [Bézier patches](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/B%C3%A9zier_surface). For details on the math, see
[this post](https://blogs.mathworks.com/graphics/2015/05/12/patch-work/) at my old Mathworks blog.
